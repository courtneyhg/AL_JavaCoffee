### ALTester
It makes a 23 integer array. First it checks if the elements are sorted in ascending
by seeing if the first index is less than or equal to the next index and so on. Next,
it sorts the array through iteration. We nested a for loop in a for loop. The first
for loop makes sure we go through the array and the second for loop makes sure the
elements are in ascending order. It compares each element with the next one and if
the first element is greater than the second then the elements are switched.
