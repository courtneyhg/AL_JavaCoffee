### ALTester
It makes a 23 integer array. First it checks if the elements are sorted in ascending
order by seeing if the first index is less than or equal to the next index and so on.
Next, it sorts the array through iteration. We nested a for loop in a for loop. The
first for loop makes sure we go through the array and the second for loop makes sure the
elements are in ascending order. It compares the element at a specific index with the
rest of the elements. If the element at index x is greater than the compared element then the elements are switched.
